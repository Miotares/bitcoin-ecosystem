# Visual Overhaul Walkthrough

I have successfully transformed the Bitcoin Ecosystem map into a premium, modern experience.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Premium Dark Mode Theme
- **Background**: Switched from generic white/gray to a deep "Midnight Blue" (`#0B0E14`).
- **Colors**: Bitcoin Orange (`#F7931A`) is now used as a vibrant accent color that "pops" against the dark background.
- **Glow Effects**: Added subtle glow filters to the central Bitcoin node and highlighted elements.

### 2. Glassmorphism UI
- **Search Bar & Controls**: Replaced standard inputs and buttons with translucent "glass" elements (blur effect, subtle white borders).
- **Detail Popup**: Redesigned as a floating glass card with a modern layout and smooth entrance animation.

### 3. Typography Upgrade
- **Headings**: Using **Outfit** for a bold, modern tech look.
- **Body Text**: Using **Inter** for maximum legibility on UI elements and data nodes.

### 4. Refined Graph Styling
- **Nodes**: Updated shapes and colors to align with the dark theme.
- **Links**: Made connections more subtle to reduce visual clutter, highlighting them only on hover.
- **Icons**: Replaced text-based controls (+, -) with professional **Phosphor Icons**.

## Verification
Since this is a visual update, verification is primarily based on the code structure and design implementation.

- **File Structure**:
    - `style.css`: Contains all the new premium styles, variables, and animations.
    - `index.html`: Cleaned up, links to the new stylesheet, and uses the new icon set.
- **Responsiveness**: The CSS includes media queries to ensure the search bar and popup work well on mobile devices (popup becomes a bottom sheet).

## Next Steps
- Open `index.html` in your browser to see the new design in action!
